Our project is a discussion board (a forum). The whole idea is to maintain several boards, which will behave like categories. Then, inside a specific board, a user can start a new discussion by creating a new topic. In this topic, other users can engage in the discussion posting replies.

We will need to find a way to differentiate a regular user from an admin user because only the admins are supposed to create new boards. Below, an overview of our main use cases and the role of each type of user:

For us to be able to implement the use cases described in the previous section, we will need to implement at least the following models: Board, Topic, Post, and User
