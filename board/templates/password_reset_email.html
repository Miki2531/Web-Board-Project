Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{email}}.
Follow the link below:
{{ protocol}}://{{domain}}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forget your Django Boards username: {{user.username}}

If clicking the link above does't work, please copy and paste the URL in a new browser window instade.

If you've recievied this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email 
address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you don't initiate the request, you don't
need to take any further and can safly disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Board Team
